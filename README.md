## About the project

This project was built with React.js using Creat React App. It is a ``mystery box service delivery``, where user, based on his choices, will receive monthly or weekly, different kind of mindfullness products.

### Motivation

I was motivated to create this project by the lack of mystery box related with mindfullness in Brazil and to meet increasing customer demand about mindfullness products in our country.

### Usage

As a user, you can create an account at ``Sign Up`` page and login into the platform at ``Sign In`` page. Then, at ``user`` page, user will see a description of each ``plan``. By clicking on ``Assinar``, user will be redirected to new plan ``subscription``, where he will choose the ``plan``, ``delivery date``, ``products categories`` and finally, his delivery address.
After that, finishing his ``subscription``, user will be redirect to ``user`` page again, but instead of plan descriptions, he will see his ``deliveries information``.

- **Products categories**
  - Chás
  - Incensos
  - Produtos orgânicos

- **Delivery dates**
  - *Monthly*
    - Day 1
    - Day 10
    - Day 20
  - *Weekly*
    - Monday
    - Wednesday
    - Friday
 
 Below you can see a demonstration of how it works and a link to access the application in real time.
