The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

**Note that you will need the back-end, available in: https://github.com/Calil-Silva/gratibox-back

## Deployed on Vercel

If you want to see the app running without the need of GratiBox API, you can access https://gratibox-front-phi.vercel.app/, since GratiBox API is deployed in Heroku and front-end in Vercel, is pointing to Heroku.
